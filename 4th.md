i'm a digital producer based in london and working in-house and as a freelancer in creative industries for several years.

i specialise in creation of interactive content of different complexity and at different stages of development. i primarily work with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and worked on number of open source projects available on github.

in recent years i worked on variety of web projects from [research](https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-services-and-communities-folder/diaspora-changemakers/) using data driven document frameworks d3.js to [complimentary digital campaigns](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62) assisting pan-europen tours of political activists.
 
the project relies on 3d technology called webGL which allows to display interactive 2 and 3D computer graphics which will make up the environment of the virtual art gallery within a web browser.

the budget will easily allow to hire freelance javascript programmers particularly those working with [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) or [three.js](http://threejs.org/) via services like [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) as well as necessary editors or copywriters.
