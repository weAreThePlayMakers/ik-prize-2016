I'm a digital producer from London working for several years in-house and freelance in creative industries.

I specialise in production of interactive content of different complexity and at different stages of development. I primarily work with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and worked on variety of web based  projects from [research](https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-services-and-communities-folder/diaspora-changemakers/) using data driven document frameworks d3.js to [complimentary digital campaigns](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62) assisting pan-europen tours of political activists.

The proposed project relies on open source web technologies (webGL, three.js and one of available JavaScript game engines) that could allow to display interactive 3D computer graphics which will then make up the environment of the virtual art gallery within a web browser.

The budget would easily allow to hire developers and designers via services like codepen.io, GitHub and Dribble.
