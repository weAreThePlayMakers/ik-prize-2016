art-i-nviro is a 3D virtual reality gallery space displayed on  computer screen, mobile device or VR headset, like Oculus Rift. The virtual space, filled with artworks, provides information to user in form of text, video and sound. Displayed material allows users to interact with artwork using either simple gamefication features or custom made game mechanics.

Once connected to the web application a user is guided through “rooms”, which gather information like age, preferences, favourite artists, etc., which allows for the app to offer a potential path through the gallery.

The artwork is accompanied by additional information and stories related to this particular piece of art. These could be images of sketch-works, previous versions of artwork, techniques used to create it as well as additional information about the artist, snippets of interviews in video panels floating in 3D space.

Virtual gallery would resemble knowledge tree of modern art. Some artists will have their own virtual rooms which might be displayed using particular artist style, form of expression or even show place where they were born. For example, a user, could experience the artworks of Calder with the contextual information in a space that itself is a massive 3D replica of one of Calder’s compositions.

The interface of the gallery could be accessed on a mobile device and act as a guide through the physical gallery, interacting in exactly the same way, with only limitations due to physical space and/or artwork displayed in the gallery.
