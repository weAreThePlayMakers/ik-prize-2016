The proposal is to create a 3D virtual reality gallery space displayed on either computer screen, mobile device or using VR headset, like Oculus Rift. The Virtual space, filled with artworks, provides information to a user in form of text, video and sound. Displayed material allows users to interact with artwork using either simple gamefication features or custom made game mechanics.

A user connects to the web application via device of their choice and is guided though “rooms”, which gather the information like age, preferences, favourite artists, etc., which allows for the app to offer a potential path through the gallery.

The artwork is accompanied by additional information and stories related to any particular piece of art. A user might be able to see images of sketch-works, previous versions of an artwork, techniques used to create it as well as read additional information about an artist, snippets of interviews in video panels floating in 3D space.

The virtual gallery resembles the genealogical tree of modern art. Some artists will have their own virtual rooms accessed from the main area which might be displayed using particular artist style, form of expression or place where they were born. For example, a user, could experience the artworks of Calder as 3D models of the original work and contextual information which is “hanging” in a space that in itself is a replica of one of Calder’s compositions.

The interface of the gallery could be accessed on a mobile device and act as a guide through the actual gallery, interacting in exactly the same way, with only limitations due to physical space and/or artwork displayed in the gallery.

the project relies on 3d technology called [webGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) which allows to display interactive 3D and 2D computer graphics which will create the environment of the virtual art gallery within a web browser.

the budget will easily allow to hire freelance javascript programmers particularly those working with [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) or [three.js](http://threejs.org/) via services like [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/).
